        This website will be a space that can be used a virtual resume. It will showcase what a typical online 
        resume would look like. Anyone wanting a place where they can easily access their resume and not have to 
        print one out anytime a paper one is asked for.  Having an online resume means you can easily update the 
        information and style it to your own likings. For this website I will need a list of all the places you 
        have worked as well as any qualifications you have and would like displayed on your resume. The main page 
        will feature the introduction to who you are and what you bring to the table for the place you are applying
        at. Any subpages will have more detailed info such as references and previous places of employment. 
        Maybe even a page with your own personal interests that you may not put on a traditional resume.
