            I am a computer science major, not sure yet what I want to do with that degree. My hobbies include video games, and music. 
        I know one song on the harmonica and I know a handful of YoYo tricks. I enjoy going shooting and I recently got into knife throwing
        I am not that good yet.

            I currently work for Salt Lake Express doing payroll for the bus drivers. I do not plan to make that my career, video game 
        design or at least a job in the video game industry would be the dream. Learning about web design is something I am mildly interested
        in, I think knowing how to make or fix a website will be a useful skill when I start working in the field of computer sciences.

        I have been a member my entire life (25 years). I grew up in Orem, Utah. I served a mission in the Nebraska Omaha Mission, which
        abbreviates to NOM so now when I refer to my mission I can say "back in NOM"
